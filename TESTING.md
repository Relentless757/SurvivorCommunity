# SurvivorCommunity — in-game test checklist

Steps not yet tested in game. Tick a step, or remove it, once it has been confirmed. Everything below was added on
2026-09-28 and ships in the build `sc_stage7`, which is **not deployed yet**.

## Useful console commands (F1)

**Outposts and POIs**

- `sc poi` shows the POI you stand in: what it would produce, why, and whether it is cleared.
- `sc poi near 500` lists outpost candidates around you.
- `sc outpost list` shows each outpost's type, level, mode and state, and the network's radio state and debts.
- `sc outpost yield` shows tonight's numbers.
- `sc outpost security <id>` gives the security breakdown and the attack chance.

**Radio**

- `sc radio` lists the remembered radios and their live power.
- `sc scout <res>` scouts for a resource and ignores the once-a-day wait.
- `sc barter <give> <get>` trades once and ignores the once-a-day wait.

**Time and stockpile**

- `sc day` simulates one rollover, outposts included.
- `sc give mats 10` / `sc give fuel 5` fill the stockpile for fees and upkeep.
- `settime` also works, but bare `settime day` resets the world to day 1.

## 2026-09-29 build (sc_stage8)

- [ ] **Missing members can be called back.** A resident whose body is gone from the world (Gina in TestSurvivor3)
      shows "Missing - Call back" about 45 s after you reach home, with a tooltip. Pick her and press **Call back**:
      she respawns at her post with her look, gear, skills and traits. The console equivalent is
      `sc restore <name>`. Anything she was carrying is not restored.
- [ ] **No more "LootContainer '…' unknown" errors.** Opening and closing linked storage, outpost storage, or home
      storage from an outpost writes no ERR lines. The window title is unchanged, and it still opens as the grid.

## Fixes to features you already have (in the same build)

- [ ] **Radio contacts now spawn for every NPC class.** About half of the classes (any whose id hash is negative,
      e.g. the Nurse) used to be dropped with "radio contact class … no longer exists" in the log, and the same
      survivors got no distress stand-in. Call a few contacts; each should appear when you reach its POI.
- [ ] **Distress fights get their full pack of zombies** (half of the zombie classes used to be skipped).
      Walking away until they unload no longer counts as a rescue: come back and finish it, or it resolves at the
      rollover.
- [ ] **Stand-ins are protected.** A survivor's stand-in (distress or outpost) can't be hired, ordered or picked up,
      and your own shots don't hurt it unless community friendly fire is on.

## v1: establishing and daily production

- [ ] Standing in a POI, `sc poi` names its type. `sc poi census` gives sensible counts for the world.
- [ ] Place a land claim inside a **cleared** POI at least 150 m from home. The radial shows **Establish outpost**, and it does not appear on the home claim or on claims outside POIs.
- [ ] Establish with the home radio powered and 2 materials + 1 fuel in stock. You get a tooltip with the daily yield, a map icon, a ledger line, and the fee is taken.
- [ ] Each gate refuses with its own message:
  - the POI is not cleared;
  - it is too close to home;
  - it is already an outpost;
  - there is no free slot (2 outposts with fewer than 4 members);
  - the radio is off;
  - the fee cannot be paid.
- [ ] Run `sc day`: the stockpile rises by the yield, and the ledger/tooltip reads "outposts +n …, upkeep …".
- [ ] Unpower the home radio, then run `sc day` twice. The bundles wait at the outpost ("n waiting"). Power it again and run `sc day`: they arrive.
- [ ] With an empty materials stockpile the outposts go **run-down** (half yield), and they recover after `sc give mats`.
- [ ] Pick up the outpost's claim. Within ~10 s it is marked **Lost**, the marker goes, and morale shows a Territory penalty that fades.
- [ ] Place more claims than LandClaimCount allows. The oldest plain claim deactivates, never the home or an outpost. When only home and outpost claims are left, the new one is refused with a tooltip.
- [ ] Stay away more than 7 days: nothing respawns in the outpost POI and yields continue.
- [ ] Accept a trader quest for a POI, establish there, then walk in. No quiet sleeper reset.
- [ ] The outpost claim's radial **Linked storage** shows "Radioing home…", then opens the home storage view at the outpost. It stays open, and Refresh keeps working.
- [ ] The outpost claim's box shows the Pack / Deposit / Withdraw strip, and deposits land in the stockpile.
- [ ] **Community window, Outposts tab:** rows, the detail panel, the network summary, "+n/day" under each resource, Track on map (compass waypoint), and Disband (two presses).
- [ ] The morale panel shows **Territory**, and the radio window lists what each outpost is sending.

## v1.1: people, levels, perks, scouting

- [ ] Use **Assign** on the Outposts tab, then click a resident at home. They are posted: hidden at home, with status "Holding X", and the yield goes up.
- [ ] A second post opens at level 2.
- [ ] Walk within 60 m of a staffed outpost: a stand-in with the member's name and look guards the claim, and it disappears when you leave.
- [ ] If a stand-in dies there, the member dies (ledger and tooltip).
- [ ] A posted member's mood: −3, a Loner +5, and +3 after you visit.
- [ ] Recall with the × on a staff row, or "Recall home" on the member. The member is back at home, visible.
- [ ] **Upgrade** is refused until 3 days have passed (L2) and until someone is posted (L3). When allowed it takes the cost, and the yield and the "Level" line change.
- [ ] Perks listed with no outpost selected:
  - [ ] **Canteen** (food): hunger morale capped at −10.
  - [ ] **Field clinic** (meds): one injury healed free a day.
  - [ ] **Armed escort** (ammo): runs are safer.
  - [ ] **Salvage yard** (materials): fee and upgrade costs ×0.75.
  - [ ] **Motor pool** (fuel): runs bring more.
- [ ] Radio **Scout** buttons mark up to 3 sites for that resource on the map, once a day. The marks fade after 3 days.
- [ ] Walk-ins: a staffed outpost sometimes gets a radio contact at it (8 % a day).

## v1.2 / v1.3: extras

- [ ] **Mode** button: normal → quiet (×0.5) → push (×1.5). The yield changes in `sc outpost yield`.
- [ ] **Radio relay:** place and power a radio inside an outpost POI. `sc outpost list` shows "[relay]", and the outpost still delivers with the home radio off.
- [ ] **Workshop:** post a crafter with 12+ materials in stock and get "made 1 ammo" at the rollover. A chemist makes medical from materials and fuel.
- [ ] **Radio barter:** Give/Get buttons, then Trade, 3 for 1, once a day.
- [ ] **Distress calls** sometimes pin a runner's rescue at one of your outposts (30 %).
- [ ] **Built inside an outpost:** beds, workbench/campfire, and crops for food outposts raise its yield. The detail shows "(+n% built)", and `sc outpost list` shows the counts.
- [ ] **Outpost storage** on an outpost claim: one view over that POI's player boxes.
- [ ] **Outpost Flag** (craftable: 5 small rocks, 5 cloth, 5 scrap iron) placed in a cleared, eligible POI establishes itself. Anywhere else it is a plain claim, with a tooltip saying why.
- [ ] Off by default, test only if switched on in `Config/blocks.xml`:
  - [ ] `OutpostStashAndHaul`
  - [ ] `OutpostCheckInDays`
  - [ ] `OutpostDepletion`

## v2: risk (set `OutpostAttacks` to `true` in Config/blocks.xml, ConfigSurvivorCommunity)

- [ ] `sc outpost security <id>` gives a sensible breakdown. Defenses built there (spikes, wire, traps, turrets) raise it.
- [ ] Attack call:
  - [ ] `sc outpost attack <id>` gives a tooltip and a red skull on the map and compass. The detail reads "UNDER ATTACK – n h".
  - [ ] Go there: zombies spawn around the POI and go for the stand-in or you. Kill them all and it holds, with a security bonus and morale.
  - [ ] Ignore it until the deadline: it holds, is damaged (no yield for 2 days; **Repair** for 2 materials), or is overrun (sleepers back, staff home injured). Nobody dies.
- [ ] `sc outpost attack <id> raid` sends raiders instead of zombies.
- [ ] Raider demand: `sc outpost demand <id>` puts a row in the radio window. **Pay** takes 2 ammo + 2 food. **Refuse** starts a raider attack, and so does an unanswered demand at the next rollover.
- [ ] Blood moon: at its end, every outpost you were not standing at rolls on security (−15).
- [ ] Neglect: an unstaffed outpost unvisited for 10 days gets one sleeper area re-armed and becomes Contested.
- [ ] Good news (on by default): a cache of 2–4 bundles appears in the claim box when you next visit.
